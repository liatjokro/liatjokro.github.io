The room was dimmed. The sun had just set, leaving behind a faint glow of orange-reddish hue in the sky, that permeated the room and blessed everything in the room with some dim, orange hues. The double bed, the table with a tv and an old video player, smell of freshly-cleaned bathroom. Freshly-cleaned with those hospital-grade bleach that left behind a strong, nauseating odour...

A little girl jumped on the bed. Up and down, up and down. She squeaked happily as, from time to time, she let herself fall and rolled on the bed before she got up and started jumping again. She must have been about four. Her white-blue flowery sleeveless dress twirled around as she jumped around on the bed, carefree, careless, and yes, she had completely forgotten the number one cardinal rule in the bedroom: No Jumping on the Bed!

“Nina!” a voice called out to the little girl. A woman in her thirties, pregnant in late trimester, carrying a travel bag, came into the bedroom.

The girl, Nina, stopped jumping and jumped off the bed to give the woman a big hug. “Mama! Are you going somewhere?!”

The woman looked tired and nodded weakly with a smile that failed to hide a deep crease of worry on her forehead. Never mind. Nina did not notice that.

“Yes, Nina. Mama is going to the hospital…”

“Why?!” Nina tilted her head and her eyes widened in wonder.

“The doctor…well…the babies are coming, Nina! Your sisters, the twin in my tummy now!”

Nina nodded. She and Mama had talked about the babies many, many times. She would have not just one, but two, little sisters! How cool! Actually, she already had another little sister, Sasha, who was just a year younger than her. So, Nina was four, and Sasha was three. Grandma helped her count that.

“There will be four girls in this house, Mama,” Nina counted in her head. Mama smiled and nodded.

“Nina, promise me you will behave, and you will look out for your sisters. Ok?”

Nina did not really understand what a “promise” was actually. She guessed promise meant something that had to be done, like when Mama promised her a new dress for her birthday, she actually got a dress on that day!

So Nina nodded. “I promise!” 

And Mama left.

But Mama never came back.

Nina was confused. So confused she did not cry when papa, and her grandparents came home the next day crying their eyeballs out.

Some neighbours gathered, and one of them carried Nina, hugged her, and kept saying how sorry she was.

She heard that Mama had gone to heaven and become an angel there.

She heard that Mama had “massive bleeding” when she gave birth to the twin babies. What does that mean? Nina thought and thought, but nobody explained to her.

She heard that Mama fell in a very deep sleep, but not before she asked how the twin babies were. The twin babies were fine. They were beautiful. Mama was not fine. She never woke up.

Nina was confused. Very confused. Everybody was sad, everybody cried, and she got carried around a lot.

Oh, they let her see Mama one last time. On a bed, and the bed was in a big wooden box. A “coffin.”

Mama was beautiful with makeup on, and white dress with laces and ruffles. But she was so quiet, so different. She was not smiling, and oh, how Nina wished to see her smile!

They put Mama in a hole on the ground. Nina cried and cried, finally. I want Mama! Mama!

>>>

Days and days after that, Nina learned fast, what “grief “ was. Her father stopped talking for some time and just laid on the bed with tears streaming down his face.

Sasha cried a lot.

The twin babies cried a lot.

Her grandparents loved them dearly, and tried their utmost best to raise them well.

Nina and her sisters grew, and Nina, for a time, wanted to be an angel, so she could fly and find Mama up there in heaven.

Nina, for a time, believed that there was a little hole in the sky, where her mama would peek at her.

Nina remembered always the promise she made her mama that day. She looked out for her sisters and behaved herself.

If only she had known, that day was her last day, ever, with Mama, she would have hugged her tighter, and, oh, not jumped on the bed. She knew Mama hated that.

She would have told Mama she loved her, very much, definitely much more than her love for her Barbie dolls and toy cooking set.

She would have looked into her eyes more carefully and let it frozen in her memory, so she would always, always remember the exact colour of her eyes.

She would have smelled her more intensely, so she would remember her smell.

She would have paused and listened to her voice, so she would remember the tone, the intonation, the way she sounded.

She would have…
